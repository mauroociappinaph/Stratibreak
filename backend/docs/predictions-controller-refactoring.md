# Predictions Controller Refactoring

## Overview

The predictions controller has been refactored to improve code organization, maintainability, and follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). The main changes involve moving statistical calculation methods from the controller to the dedicated `RiskCalculatorService`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Statistical Methods Migration

**Moved from Controller to RiskCalculatorService:**

- `calculateRiskVolatility(values: number[]): number`
- `calculateSkewness(values: number[]): number`
- `calculateKurtosis(values: number[]): number`

**Rationale:**

- Controllers should handle HTTP concerns only, not business logic
- Statistical calculations belong in a dedicated service
- Improves testability and reusability
- Follows Single Responsibility Principle

### 2. Controller Cleanup

**Removed:**

- Duplicate method implementations
- Corrupted/malformed code sections
- Private statistical helper methods
- Unused imports and dependencies

**Fixed:**

- TypeScript compilation errors
- Method signature inconsistencies
- Missing return type annotations
- Decorator syntax issues

### 3. Service Integration

**Updated method calls:**

```typescript
// Before (in controller)
this.calculateRiskVolatility(monteCarloResult.riskDistribution);

// After (using service)
this.riskCalculatorService.calculateRiskVolatility(
  monteCarloResult.riskDistribution
);
```

### 4. Code Structure Improvements

**Controller now focuses on:**

- HTTP request/response handling
- Parameter validation and transformation
- Delegating business logic to services
- API documentation with OpenAPI decorators

**RiskCalculatorService now handles:**

- All statistical calculations
- Risk analysis algorithms
- Monte Carlo simulations
- Mathematical operations

## Benefits

1. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Controller handles HTTP, service handles calculations
2. **Improved Testability**: Statistical methods can be tested independently
3. **Code Reusability**: Statistical methods can be used by other services
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to modify and extend statistical functionality
5. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript types throughout the codebase

## API Endpoints Affected

The following endpoints continue to work as before but now use the refactored architecture:

- `POST /predictions/monte-carlo-risk-analysis` - Uses statistical methods from RiskCalculatorService
- `POST /predictions/calculate-risk-probability` - Risk calculation delegated to service
- `GET /predictions/history/:projectId` - History retrieval with proper typing
- `GET /predictions/trend-history/:projectId` - Trend analysis with service delegation
- `GET /predictions/accuracy-metrics/:projectId` - Accuracy metrics calculation

## Testing Impact

- Unit tests for statistical methods should now target `RiskCalculatorService`
- Controller tests can focus on HTTP handling and service integration
- Integration tests remain unchanged as API contracts are preserved

## Future Improvements

1. Consider extracting more complex business logic from controller methods
2. Add comprehensive error handling for statistical calculations
3. Implement caching for expensive Monte Carlo simulations
4. Add input validation for statistical method parameters

## Migration Notes

- No breaking changes to API contracts
- All existing API documentation remains valid
- Service injection properly configured in controller constructor
- Statistical methods now have proper error handling and edge case management
