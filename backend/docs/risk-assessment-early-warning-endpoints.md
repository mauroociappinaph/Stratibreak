- Calculates warning, critical, and emergency thresholds
- Adapts thresholds based on project-specific patterns
- Provides threshold adaptation reasoning

### 7. Comprehensive Early Warnings

**Endpoint:** `POST /predictions/comprehensive-warnings`

**Description:** Advanced early warning system with multiple data sources and correlation analysis.

**Features:**

- Correlates data from multiple sources
- Identifies compound warning scenarios
- Provides comprehensive warning analysis
- Includes data source attribution for transparency

## Requirements Compliance
