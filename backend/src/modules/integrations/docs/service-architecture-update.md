# Integration Services Architecture Update

## Overview

This document summarizes the architectural improvements made to the integrations module, including the implementation of specialized services and comprehensive OpenAPI documentation updates.

## Service Architecture Changes

### New Services Implemented

#### 1. ConnectionLifecycleService

- **Purpose**: Manages connection state transitions and lifecycle events
- **Key Methods**:
  - `disconnectTool()`: Gracefully disconnects tool connections
  - `reconnectTool()`: Reconnects previously disconnected tools
  - `checkConnectionHealth()`: Performs comprehensive health checks
- **Features**:
  - Tool-specific cleanup procedures
  - Connection state validation
  - Health diagnostics with response time measurement

#### 2. ConnectionSetupService

- **Purpose**: Handles connection setup, validation, and configuration management
- **Key Methods**:
  - `isValidToolType()`: Validates supported tool types (JIRA, ASANA, TRELLO, MONDAY, BITRIX24)
  - `createConnectionConfig()`: Creates tool-specific configurations with standardized defaults
  - `testToolConnection()`: Tests connection validity with detailed error reporting
- **Features**:
  - Tool-specific credential validation with detailed error messages
  - Configuration standardization (30s timeout, 3 retry attempts)
  - Connection testing with comprehensive validation logic
  - Support for multiple authentication patterns (API tokens, OAuth, etc.)

#### 3. SyncHistoryService

- **Purpose**: Manages synchronization history and statistics
- **Key Methods**:
  - `storeSyncResult()`: Stores sync operation results
  - `getSyncHistory()`: Retrieves paginated sync history
  - `getSyncStatistics()`: Provides sync analytics
- **Features**:
  - Persistent sync result storage
  - Historical data analysis
  - Performance metrics tracking
